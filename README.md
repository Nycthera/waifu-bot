# 💖🍌 Insanely Silly Waifu — MAX CHAOS EDITION 🍌💖

A Streamlit-powered roleplay chatbot that transforms into an **absurdly silly anime waifu**.  
She glomps, sobs dramatically, spouts puns, writes haikus, and sometimes knits hats for your folder icons.  
All interactions are **fictional, safe, and chaos-driven**. 🎭✨

## 🚀 Features

- **Chaos slider** — more chaos = more emojis, puns, repeats, and absurdity.  
- **Waifu moods** — random dere archetypes (`yandere`, `tsundere`, `deredere`, etc.).  
- **Emoji barrages** — storms of 🥺👉👈, 😳, 💖, and other expressive nonsense.  
- **Haiku generator** — writes nonsense haikus about your input.  
- **SFX stage directions** — `*glomps you*`, `*brandishes a foam spatula*`, etc.  
- **Super-SUPER Mode** — unlocked with the secret passcode. Even sillier.  
- **Cookie offerings mini-game** 🍪 — give cookies, get dramatic reactions.  
- **Extra giggle gadgets** 🤪 — sock rituals, nonsense songs, and more.  
- **Typing effect** — replies “typed out” in the chat window.
